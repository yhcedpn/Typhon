# tsh Schema Shell Commands
> Inspect, diff, validate, and export a database's persisted schema interactively, without writing code.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented · **Visibility:** Internal · **Category:** [Schema](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

Checking schema state today means writing a throwaway program against `DatabaseSchema.Inspect`/`ValidateEvolution`, or stepping through code in a debugger. During day-to-day development and ops triage — "what FieldId did Score actually get?", "will my new build open this file?", "what changed last Tuesday?" — that overhead is disproportionate to the question. The Typhon Shell (`tsh`) exposes the same persisted-schema-vs-runtime-schema comparison as five interactive commands, so these questions get answered in seconds at a prompt.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

The commands read two things `tsh` already has once a database is open: the **persisted** schema (component/field metadata stored in the file, surfaced via `DatabaseEngine.PersistedComponents` / `PersistedFieldsByComponent`) and the **runtime** schema (component structs loaded into the shell via `load-schema`). `schema-diff` and `schema-validate` compute a `SchemaDiff` between the two and report the compatibility level Typhon would use on next open. `schema-fields` and `schema-export` read persisted metadata only — no runtime type needed. `schema-history` reads the `Typhon.Schema.History` system component, an append-only audit trail of every schema change ever applied. Output is color-coded markup in the console, or structured JSON/CSV via `set format` for piping into other tools.

## 💻 Usage

```
tsh> open game.typhon
tsh> load-schema bin/Game.Components.dll

tsh> schema-fields Player
  FieldId  Name      Type    Offset  Size  Index
        0  Health    Int32        0     4
        1  Mana      Int32        4     4  Unique
        2  Armor     Int32        8     4
        4  Shield    Int32       12     4   ← FieldId 3 (Legacy) was removed

tsh> schema-diff Player
  Level: Compatible  Summary: +1 field, -1 field
  + Shield (Added, FieldId=4)
  - Legacy (Removed, FieldId=3)
  Stride change: 24 → 28 bytes
  Entity count: 15000

tsh> schema-validate
  OK       Game.Inventory   — identical
  MIGRATE  Game.Equipment   — Durability Int32→Float (migration registered)
  All 2 component(s) valid.

tsh> schema-history
  2026-02-20 14:30:05  Game.Player  rev 1→2 (Compatible)  15000  0ms

tsh> set format json
tsh> schema-export Player
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `schema-fields <component>` | Persisted FieldId → name/type/offset/index mapping |
| `schema-diff <component>` | Persisted vs. runtime diff, with compatibility level |
| `schema-validate` | Dry-run diff for every loaded component against the open database |
| `schema-history` | Append-only audit trail of past schema changes |
| `schema-export [component]` | Persisted schema as table/JSON/CSV (`set format`) |

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- Read-only: none of these commands register a component, allocate storage, or migrate a single entity — `schema-diff`/`schema-validate` reuse the same dry-run diff machinery the engine uses on real open, but never apply it.
- Component name resolution accepts a short name (suffix match, case-insensitive) or the full registered `[Component]` name — no need to type the fully-qualified name.
- `schema-diff`/`schema-validate` need a runtime type loaded via `load-schema` to compare against; `schema-fields`/`schema-export`/`schema-history` work from persisted metadata alone.
- `schema-validate` reports `MIGRATE` (not `FAIL`) only when a breaking change has a registered migration chain reachable from the persisted revision to the runtime revision; otherwise it reports `FAIL` with no path to open the database as-is.
- `schema-history` is empty until at least one schema change (compatible evolution or migration) has actually been applied to the database.
- All five commands require an open database (`open <path>`); there is no offline/file-only mode in the shell — for that, use `DatabaseSchema.Inspect`/`ValidateEvolution` directly (see Related).
