# Exhaustion Policy & ResourceExhaustedException
> A typed exception for bounded resources hitting their limit, plus policy metadata that documents — but does not yet drive — the response.

**Status:** 🚧 Partial · **Visibility:** Public · **Level:** 🔵 Core · **Category:** [Resources](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

Bounded resources (transaction slots, epoch registry slots, growable segments) eventually run out.
Applications need a single, typed way to detect "this resource is full" and decide whether to
retry, back off, or surface an error — instead of catching generic exceptions or timeouts and
guessing at the cause. `ResourceExhaustedException` is that signal: it names the resource, its
current usage, and its limit, so callers can react programmatically rather than by parsing a
message string.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

Each `ResourceNode` records an `ExhaustionPolicy` (`None`, `FailFast`, `Wait`, `Evict`, `Degrade`)
at construction, describing how that component is *supposed* to behave when full. Today this is
**diagnostic metadata only** — nothing reads it to dispatch behavior. The actual FailFast paths are
hand-coded independently at each call site: UoW ID allocation (`UowRegistry.AllocateUowId`),
segment growth (`ChunkBasedSegment.AllocateChunk`/`AllocateChunks`), and the epoch thread registry
all throw `ResourceExhaustedException` directly when they hit capacity. Wait/Evict/Degrade
components (page cache, WAL staging buffers, transaction pooling) implement the described behavior
in their own code, not through the enum. Treat `ExhaustionPolicy` as documentation you can read off
a node, not a switch you can hook.

## 💻 Usage

```csharp
using Typhon.Engine;

try
{
    var uowId = uowRegistry.AllocateUowId(); // FailFast: throws if no slot is free
}
catch (ResourceExhaustedException ex)
{
    // ex.ResourcePath   -> "Execution/UowRegistry/AllocateUowId"
    // ex.CurrentUsage / ex.Limit / ex.Utilization
    if (ex.IsTransient)
    {
        // Safe to retry after a short backoff — slots free up as other UoWs finish.
    }
}

// The deadline-bounded overload waits instead of failing immediately, then throws
// ResourceExhaustedException only once the deadline expires:
var wc = WaitContext.FromTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(50));
var uowId2 = uowRegistry.AllocateUowId(ref wc);

// ExhaustionPolicy is inspectable but purely informational:
var node = (ResourceNode)registry.FindByPath("Root/Durability/StagingBufferPool");
Console.WriteLine(node.ExhaustionPolicy); // ExhaustionPolicy.Wait — describes intent, not enforced by this property
```

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- `ResourceExhaustedException.IsTransient` is always `true` — the resource may self-heal (a slot
  frees up, a pool drains); callers should treat it as retryable, not fatal.
- Confirmed FailFast throw sites today: `UowRegistry.AllocateUowId` (with and without a deadline),
  `ChunkBasedSegment.AllocateChunk`/`AllocateChunks` (segment at max capacity), and the epoch
  thread registry (`ThrowHelper.ThrowEpochRegistryExhausted`).
- `ExhaustionPolicy` on `ResourceNode` is **not** enforced anywhere — setting it, or reading it back,
  has no runtime effect. Don't build logic that branches on a node's `ExhaustionPolicy`; it will not
  match actual behavior for every component and may not be updated when a component's real strategy
  changes.
- `ResourceType`, `CurrentUsage`, and `Limit` are populated by the call site, not derived — a bug at
  the throw site (e.g. stale usage count) is not caught by the exception type itself.
- Not all Wait/Evict/Degrade components surface `ResourceExhaustedException` on their slow path —
  some report exhaustion as a timeout or a boolean return instead; check the specific component's
  API before assuming a uniform exception contract engine-wide.

- [ExhaustionPolicyTests](https://github.com/Log2n-io/Typhon/blob/main/test/Typhon.Engine.Tests/Errors/ExhaustionPolicyTests.cs) — real FailFast enforcement at
  `TransactionPool.CreateTransaction` and `ChunkBasedSegment.AllocateChunk`/`AllocateChunks`, `ResourceNode.ExhaustionPolicy` metadata
