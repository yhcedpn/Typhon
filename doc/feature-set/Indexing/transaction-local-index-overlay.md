# Transaction-Local Index Overlay (Read-Your-Own-Writes)
> Planned per-transaction overlay so index lookups see that transaction's own uncommitted writes.

**Status:** 📋 Planned · **Visibility:** Public · **Level:** 🟣 Advanced · **Category:** [Indexing](./README.md)

## 🎯 What it solves

Secondary indexes are maintained on the commit path, not as part of the transaction body. So today, an entity you just `Spawn`ed or updated inside a still-open transaction is invisible to `EnumerateIndex` calls made later in that same transaction — even though direct component reads of that entity work fine via the transaction's own read-your-own-writes cache. This asymmetry is surprising: code that creates an entity and immediately looks it up by a secondary key gets a miss, not the entity it just wrote.

## ⚙️ How it works (in brief)

A per-transaction, in-memory overlay records the index-key additions and removals implied by the transaction's own `Spawn`/update/delete calls, without touching the persistent B+Tree. Index reads (`EnumerateIndex` and friends) merge the overlay with the persistent tree before returning results, so uncommitted same-transaction changes appear alongside committed data. On `Commit()`, the overlay's changes are written into the persistent B+Tree exactly as they are today; on rollback or dispose, the overlay is simply discarded — no B+Tree undo is needed. Point lookups stay cheap (an O(1) dictionary check plus the existing tree lookup); range scans against the overlay's uncommitted entries may be more limited than committed-data range scans (e.g. unordered until merged) — final behavior depends on the implementation.

## 💻 Usage

```csharp
// Illustrative only — not implemented yet. Today, this pattern misses:
var nameIndex = engine.GetIndexRef<Player, String64>(p => p.Name);

using var tx = engine.CreateQuickTransaction();
var id = tx.Spawn<Player>(Player.Data.Set(player));   // component written; index NOT yet updated

using var hit = tx.EnumerateIndex<Player, String64>(nameIndex, player.Name, player.Name);
hit.MoveNext();   // false today — overlay would make this true once shipped

tx.Commit();
```

## ⚠️ Guarantees & limits

- **Not implemented.** No `TransactionIndexOverlay`, `_additions`/`_removals` tracking, or overlay-aware merge path exists in `src/Typhon.Engine/Indexing/` today; this entry documents a planned fix, not shipped behavior.
- **Current behavior:** `EnumerateIndex` and other secondary-index lookups only ever see committed data — a transaction cannot find its own just-created or just-updated entities via an index until it commits. Workaround today: track entity IDs directly instead of relying on an index lookup for an entity you just wrote in the same transaction.
- Once delivered, intended to give full read-your-own-writes semantics for index reads, matching the guarantee component reads already have via the transaction cache.
- Designed to preserve today's rollback simplicity (discard an in-memory structure, no B+Tree undo) and today's write amplification (one physical B+Tree write per field at commit, not one per intermediate update).
- Memory cost scales with the indexed fields a transaction actually touches — expected small for typical transactions (tens to low hundreds of entities).
- Primary-key lookups are unaffected by this gap: PK access goes through the transaction's component cache, not the secondary-index path.
