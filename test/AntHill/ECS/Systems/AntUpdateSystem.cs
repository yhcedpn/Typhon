/// <list type="number">
///   <item>Energy decay + respawn — gated by per-tier <c>AmortMetabolism</c> rate; emits AntDiedEvent.</item>
///   <item>Position integration + edge-bounce reflection.</item>
///   <item>Food/nest interaction — pickup reverses heading; smell-only hit steers toward food; drop at nest. Emits FoodPickedUp/Delivered.</item>
///   <item>Pheromone steering — gated by <c>AmortBrain</c> rate; skipped this tick on pickup/respawn (smell-override).</item>
///   <item>Pheromone deposit — gated by <c>AmortPheroDep</c> rate; <c>amortScale</c> preserves the time-integrated pheromone field.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// <para><b>Inter-cluster pheromone ordering</b> — within a single ant, step 4 (sense) reads the grid before step 5 (deposit) writes it.
/// Across clusters running on parallel workers, step 5 deposits may interleave with step 4 reads on another cluster's ants. This relaxes
/// the previous phase-barrier guarantee (Brain phase strictly before Trail phase). The race is bounded by the 0.995/tick decay factor and
/// is imperceptible in simulation output. Documented as a deliberate trade for cluster-walk cache locality.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Phase relationship</b> — runs in <see cref="AntPhases.Simulation"/> after <c>TierAssignment</c> (Phase.Input).
/// <c>PheroDecay</c> (Phase.Trail) runs after on the W×W on PheromoneGrid. Render pipeline reads
/// the ant component state from this tick's output.</para>
