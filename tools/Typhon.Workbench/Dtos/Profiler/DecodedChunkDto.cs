/// <summary>
/// JSON projection of a single profiler chunk. The binary <c>GET /chunks/{idx}</c> endpoint returns
/// the LZ4-compressed packed records (cheap on the wire, requires the codec to interpret); this DTO
/// is what <c>GET /chunks/{idx}/decoded</c> returns — a fully-deserialized event list ready for
/// inspection from any HTTP client without needing the Typhon profiler library.
///
/// Each entry in <see cref="Events"/> is a typed <see cref="TraceEventDto"/> subclass, dispatched at
/// the wire boundary by System.Text.Json's polymorphic serialization (<c>kind</c> camelCase string
/// discriminator, e.g. <c>"btreeInsert"</c>). On the TypeScript side this surfaces as a discriminated
/// union — narrowing on <c>event.kind</c> reveals exactly the payload fields for that variant.
///
/// Filtering happens server-side via <c>?kinds=</c> (CSV of <see cref="TraceEventKind"/> ints) and
/// <c>?tick=</c> (single tick), so callers can scope a 50K-event chunk down to a workable slice
/// without paying for the full payload over the wire.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="FromTick">First tick covered by the chunk (matches <c>X-Chunk-From-Tick</c> on the binary endpoint).</param>
/// <param name="ToTick">Exclusive upper bound (matches <c>X-Chunk-To-Tick</c>).</param>
/// <param name="EventCount">Total events in the chunk on disk, regardless of any active filters.</param>
/// <param name="UncompressedBytes">Decompressed payload size — useful for sizing concerns when paginating manually.</param>
/// <param name="IsContinuation">True for mid-tick split chunks (no leading TickStart record).</param>
/// <param name="TimestampFrequency">Source Stopwatch frequency. <see cref="TraceEventDto.TimestampUs"/> and <see cref="TraceSpanEventDto.DurationUs"/> are already converted; this is provided for cross-checks.</param>
/// <param name="FilteredEventCount">Number of events in <see cref="Events"/> after filters applied. Equals <see cref="EventCount"/> when no filters are passed.</param>
/// <param name="Events">Decoded event records as a polymorphic list. Each subclass carries only the fields relevant for its kind; the wire JSON uses a <c>kind</c> camelCase string as discriminator. Unknown kinds (forward-compat) decode to <c>null</c> and are filtered out before reaching this list.</param>
