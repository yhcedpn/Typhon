 * the **tick range no longer lives here** — it's derived from {@link useSelectionStore.time}, which
 * is the single source of truth shared with the profiler's TimeArea. This store now holds:
 *
 * - **stat mode** (mean / p50 / p95 / p99 / max) — drives the per-node primary stat per §6.1.
 * - **layout mode** — chooses how nodes occupy the canvas. Persisted across sessions because user
 *   layout preference is sticky (per the `useThemeStore` precedent).
 *
 * The {@link TickRange} type is still exported here because every downstream consumer
 * (`useSystemStats`, `useQueueBackpressure`, `criticalPath`) takes a tick-numbered range — the panel
 * converts the µs `useSelectionStore.time` to ticks at the boundary via {@link tickRangeMapping}.
