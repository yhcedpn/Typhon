// deactivating every deep/workspace (zone-D) view, while keeping the view sources compilable (gated, not
// deleted). This registry is the single switch — each entry below maps a dockview component id to its
// active state. Reversible per view: Stages 2-4 flip an entry to `true` as the redesigned view returns.
//
// Shell-structural surfaces (ResourceTree navigator, Detail/Inspector, Logs drawer, Options/Settings,
// PaletteDebug) are intentionally NOT listed here — `isViewActive` treats any unlisted id as always-on.
