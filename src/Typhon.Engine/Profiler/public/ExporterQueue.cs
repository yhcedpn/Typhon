/// Bounded handoff queue between the profiler consumer thread and one exporter. Wraps a <see cref="BlockingCollection{T}"/> with explicit

/// <b>Why <see cref="BlockingCollection{T}"/>?</b> It's the BCL primitive that gives us a bounded queue plus the
/// <see cref="GetConsumingEnumerable(System.Threading.CancellationToken)"/> blocking-iterator pattern that the exporter's dedicated thread runs:
/// <code>foreach (var batch in queue.GetConsumingEnumerable(ct)) { exporter.ProcessBatch(batch); batch.Release(); }</code>
/// No <c>async</c>/<c>await</c>, no thread-pool churn, just a sync exporter thread per exporter draining a bounded channel.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Drop-newest on full:</b> if <see cref="TryEnqueue"/> finds the queue at capacity, it drops the new batch (does not block the consumer thread)
/// and increments <see cref="DroppedBatches"/>. Critically, it ALSO calls <see cref="TraceRecordBatch.Release"/> on the dropped batch — without this,
/// the batch's refcount would never reach zero and the pool would leak. With it, the refcount stays balanced no matter how many exporter queues drop
/// a given batch on a given drain pass.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why drop the newest, not the oldest?</b> The newest batch hasn't started processing yet — dropping it costs nothing besides the loss of those
/// events, while dropping the oldest would either require a complex rewind or invalidate work the exporter is in the middle of doing. Tracy's design
/// philosophy: "prefer losing a sample to blocking the producer."
