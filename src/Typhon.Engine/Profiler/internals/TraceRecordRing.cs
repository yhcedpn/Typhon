/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why variable-size:</b> the old fixed 64-byte <c>TraceEvent</c> wasted 27 B per <c>BTreeInsert</c> event on scheduler
/// fields that were always zero, and forced scheduler events to pay for a trace-context slot they never used. The new layout from
/// <see cref="TraceRecordHeader"/> lets each record carry exactly the payload it needs — span events drop to ~37 B without trace context, scheduler
/// chunks drop to ~47 B, and rich transaction commits grow slightly (~63 B) while carrying 4 more fields than the old struct could.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Framing:</b> records are laid out contiguously in a power-of-2 byte buffer. Each record begins with the 12-byte
/// <see cref="TraceRecordHeader.CommonHeaderSize"/> common header whose first 2 bytes are the total record size (u16 little-endian). The consumer
/// walks <c>_tail</c> forward by reading that size field and jumping. A special sentinel value <see cref="TraceRecordHeader.WrapSentinel"/>
/// (<c>0xFFFF</c>) at the start of a slot means "this slot is padding to the end of the buffer — jump the read pointer to the next wrap boundary"
/// (used when a record wouldn't fit contiguously at the current head position).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Synchronization:</b> two monotonic 64-bit counters (<c>_head</c> producer-written, <c>_tail</c> consumer-written), each wrapped in a
/// <see cref="CacheLinePaddedLong"/> so they live on distinct cache lines — avoids the producer/consumer false-sharing ping-pong that is textbook
/// for SPSC rings (Tracy pads them for the same reason). On x64 TSO, plain field reads and writes of 64-bit primitives are naturally atomic and
/// ordered, so no <see cref="System.Threading.Volatile"/> fences are needed — same as <c>ThreadTraceBuffer</c> does for the same reason
/// (see CLAUDE.md).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Even-size invariant:</b> all reservations are rounded UP to an even byte count. Since <see cref="Capacity"/> is a power of 2, this guarantees
/// that every <c>_head &amp; _mask</c> byte offset is even, and the u16 size field at the start of every record lives on an even offset. The
/// consequence: we never end up in the pathological "one byte left before the wrap, can't write a 2-byte wrap sentinel" corner case. Padding bytes
/// at the tail of each record are left at whatever value they already held — the consumer reads <c>size</c> from the header and skips the exact
/// number of bytes, so padding content is irrelevant.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Drop-newest on full:</b> when the ring is full, <see cref="TryReserve"/> returns <c>false</c> and increments a per-ring drop counter. The
/// producer hot path <b>never blocks</b> — losing a sample is always preferable to stalling the engine.
