# Typhon AWS Automation — Operator Runbook

SkyPilot tasks for ephemeral AWS instances. Two uses share this folder:

1. **CI (automated)** — the PR merge gate (`ci.sky.yaml`) and the opt-in reference benchmark
   (`benchmark.sky.yaml`), launched by GitHub Actions. See **CI use** below.
2. **AntHill trace capture (manual)** — run `AntHill.Harness` on bare metal and retrieve the
   `.typhon-trace` via S3. The runbook from "Dry run" onward covers this.

## CI use (automated — not operator-run)

Three tasks are launched by GitHub Actions, not by hand. Full design:
`claude/design/Infrastructure/ci-merge-gate.md`.

- **`ci.sky.yaml`** — the PR **merge gate**. `.github/workflows/merge-gate.yml` detects changed areas
  and blocks on `sky launch ci.sky.yaml --down`; the exit code becomes the required status check.
  Runs the engine full suite (minus `[Category("Quarantine")]`) and the workbench suites on a
  `c6id.8xlarge`, with NUnit parallelism set to the dev-machine value (`ProcessorCount/2` = 16). Reports
  land in `s3://typhon-traces/ci/<run_id>/` and are surfaced on the PR.
- **`benchmark.sky.yaml`** — opt-in **reference benchmark** on `m5d.metal`.
  `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` launches it when a PR gets the `run-benchmark` label or the
  workflow is dispatched. Results (`s3://typhon-traces/benchmark/<run_id>/`) are committed back as the
  public artifact. `m5d.metal` is the public, reproducible reference — anyone can launch it to compare.
- **`coverage.sky.yaml`** — opt-in **code coverage** on `c6id.8xlarge`. `.github/workflows/coverage.yml`
  launches it on the `run-coverage` label or dispatch; the refreshed report + history are committed back
  (coverage is hardware-independent). Kept **off** the per-PR gate — a second instrumented pass roughly
  doubles the gate's wall-clock.

The AntHill runbook below is for **manual** trace-capture runs, unrelated to CI.

Full design and one-time operator setup: see
`design/Infrastructure/skypilot-aws-automation.md` in the `typhon-claude` docs repo.

## Prerequisites (one-time)

WSL + AWS CLI + SkyPilot installed, a dedicated `skypilot-bot` IAM user, the
`typhon-traces` S3 bucket in `eu-west-1`, and a 128-vCPU service-quota increase.
Work through the design doc's **Operator Setup Guide**, then confirm:

```bash
sky check aws        # must report: AWS: enabled
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ci.sky.yaml`             | **CI** merge-gate task — `c6id.8xlarge`, engine + workbench (driven by `merge-gate.yml`) |
| `benchmark.sky.yaml`      | **CI** reference benchmark — `m5d.metal`, opt-in (driven by `benchmark.yml`) |
| `coverage.sky.yaml`       | **CI** code coverage — `c6id.8xlarge`, opt-in (driven by `coverage.yml`) |
| `anthill-bench.sky.yaml`  | Production task — `m6idn.metal`, the 500K-ant scenario |
| `anthill-dryrun.sky.yaml` | Dry-run task — `c5d.metal`, a small trace-on scenario |
| `run.sh`                  | Thin wrapper — launches the production task with `--down` |

## 1. Dry run — do this first

Validates provisioning, NVMe mount, build, harness run, and trace→S3 retrieval
cheaply on `c5d.metal` before spending on a production run:

```bash
sky launch bench/aws/anthill-dryrun.sky.yaml --down -y
```

Then verify:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://typhon-traces/   # expect the dry-run .typhon-trace + JSON report
sky status                      # expect no active cluster
```

A green dry run is the gate to the production run.

## 2. Production run

```bash
./bench/aws/run.sh
# equivalently: sky launch bench/aws/anthill-bench.sky.yaml --down -y
```

Runs the 500K-ant scenario across the 16/32/64/128 worker sweep. Each run emits
a `.typhon-trace`; all are copied to `s3://typhon-traces/` with the JSON report.
`--down` terminates the instance when finished.

## 3. Retrieve traces

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://typhon-traces/
aws s3 cp s3://typhon-traces/<file>.typhon-trace .
```

Open the trace in the Typhon Workbench profiler.

## If an instance gets stuck

`--down` should always terminate the instance. If `sky status` still shows a
cluster, force it down:

```bash
sky down <cluster-name>
```

Cross-check the AWS EC2 console (`eu-west-1`) — a leaked `m6idn.metal` bills
~$10/hr. The account budget alarm is the backstop.

## Notes

- SkyPilot `workdir: .` syncs the local repo — the benchmark runs whatever is
  checked out. Launch from the Typhon repo root.
- Bare-metal boot takes 5–7 min, teardown 10–20 min — all billed per-second.
- The harness exits non-zero if any run fails; the task propagates that, so a
  failed benchmark surfaces as a failed SkyPilot task.
